DriverHero aims to provide an audio assistant for taxi drivers. As a first use case, it allows taxi drivers to ask for other taxis in case there are many people waiting. The driver can say: "Brauche eine Fahrt von Meran nach Bozen fÃ¼r vier Personen" and the system will record it after asking for confirmation. The technologies used in this project are Speech-To-Text, Entity recognition, Text-to-Speech, and React for the prototype UI.
